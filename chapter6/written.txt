#define N 4

int a[N] = {0, 2, 2, 3, 4}; //too many values
int b[N - 5]; //initialiser negative
int c[3.0] //initialiser not int

p points to the address of a, not to the value in it. Change it changes the pointer to point to somewhere else which contains the value 777, but the address p points to does not change.

*p + 1 should be corrected to *(p + 1). Otherwise, it just adds 1 to the value in the current p.
